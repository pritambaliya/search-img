# search-img

🔍 Just built my first API project – a mini Image Search App using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript!

🖼 The app fetches images in real-time from the API based on user search input. It features:

✅ Responsive design

✅ API integration using fetch()

✅ Search with live results and pagination

👨‍💻 This was a great experience and boosted my confidence in frontend development.
